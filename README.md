An incremental game that I am working on... 
<br><br>
Right now, all you can do is press a button, and it shows how much clicks you have. This is definitely going to be more fun later on, and it will have cool things like easter eggs, Konami code (↑↑↓↓←→←→ba), export/import saving using Base64 and hexadecimal encoding (and also cloud saving when I have time for that), and obviously CSS to make the game look neat.

Thanks to the README template, my README now looks nice!
